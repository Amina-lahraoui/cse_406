## DermFridge AI

This project presents an AI-powered personal assistant designed to connect nutrition and skincare through intelligent data analysis. By combining facial image recognition with food identification, the system determines the user’s skin type and analyzes the contents of their refrigerator to recommend personalized meals, snacks, and beverages that promote healthier skin. Beyond personalized dietary guidance, the application encourages users to make optimal use of their available ingredients, thus reducing food waste. Driven by the rise of personalized health technologies, the popularity of skincare beauty in South Korea, and the increasing accessibility of computer vision tools, this assistant bridges the gap between skincare and nutrition-focused applications. It supports both personal well-being and environmental sustainability by helping users understand the impact of dietary habits on their skin condition and guiding them toward smarter, skin-friendly food choices. Ultimately, the project aims to empower users to maintain healthy skin naturally while fostering more sustainable and informed eating practices.

#Introduction#

Coming to South Korea to study abroad, some of our members immediately noticed the prevalence of skincare, clinics, and skin analysis being offered at many stores to market their own products as a solution to any skin issues. We were inspired by skin analysis's and wanted to combine it with out coding and our assignment with working with an LG products. This is where the DermFridge AI came to be. 

We hope to see a viable product, whether it is on LG fridges, or becoming a stronger app for consumers. We hope to provide users an alternative to traveling to skincare clinics, especially those living outside of Korea, to have the comfort of checking and working on their skin's health, daily at home. Additionally, we hope to save money for users, as they can rely on their fridge nutrition more for skincare.
